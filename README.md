# Documentation
Time Ruler uses the [Dataview](obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview) plugin to read tasks, so please install it before you use this plugin.

## Reading tasks
Task metadata can be specified in any of the following formats:
- **Dataview**: [scheduled:: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm]  [due:: yyyy-mm-dd]  [length:: \#h\#m]  [priority:: lowest/low/medium/high/highest]
- **Tasks**: [startTime:: hh-mm]  [length:: #h#m] ‚è≥ yyyy-mm-dd üìÖ yyyy-mm-dd ‚è¨/üîΩ/üîº/‚è´/üî∫
- **Full Calendar**: [date:: yyyy-mm-dd]  [startTime:: hh-mm]  [endTime:: hh-mm]  [due:: yyyy-mm-dd]  [priority:: lowest/low/medium/high/highest]
When editing a task via drag-and-drop, tasks are converted to the user's preferred format (Dataview, Tasks, or Full Calendar). This can be changed in Settings. (*Note:* Double-spaces are used between brackets because without them, Obsidian thinks they are markdown links.)

## Scheduling tasks
- To reschedule a task, drag-and-drop the task onto the target block or time. You can drag a task to one of the day buttons or a day's heading to reschedule to that day. Click on a task to jump to it in Obsidian.
- To create a new scheduled task, drag the heading from the Search popover onto a target time. A new task is created under that heading.
- Dragging and holding over a date button will scroll to that date, allowing you to drop the task there.
- To change the length of a task, drag it by the bottom (the "resize arrow" cursor) to a target time.
- You can also drag groups, headings, and blocks to reschedule all of the tasks contained in them.
- The "Upcoming" view shows any upcoming due dates in a zoomed-out time ruler. Drag a task on this ruler to schedule its due date.

## Online calendars
- To import a calendar, simply copy a shared link (iCal format) into Settings.
- Events show as blocks which can contain tasks scheduled at the same time. You can drag an event to reschedule the tasks contained, but the event is read-only. 
- To refresh events, click the "Refresh" button (the circular arrow) in the toolbar.

## Timer
- To start a stopwatch, click the play button without any time entered.
- To start a timer, enter an amount in minutes and press the play button or "Enter."
- You can add or subtract time while the timer is playing. 

# Credit
- Many thanks to the [Dataview](obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview), [Tasks](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin), and [Full Calendar](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-full-calendar) plugins for setting the standards and formatting for managing tasks across the Obsidian vault.
- The Dataview plugin's MetadataCache made Time Ruler possible, so a huge thanks for the automatic indexing and parsing of task metadata.
